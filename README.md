Designed to be fast, free, and it stops monopolization. *I think.*
## What Does It Include?
- Minecraft server verification code
- Discord bot
- Queues
- Different Gamemodes
- Website with rankings and search
- Points system
## What Are The Requirements?
You must have a virtual machine with at least 12 GB of RAM and 2 vCores with Pterodactyl installed. The location does not matter. I recommend looking into Hetzner, Contabo, HopOne, or Hostinger.
If you're using an Oracle ARM instance, that also works too.
